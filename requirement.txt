-Debouncing concept

typing slow = 200ms
typing fast = 30ms

Performance:
    -iphone pro max = 14 letter * 1000 = 140000
    -with Debouncing = 3 API call * 1000 = 3000

Debouncing with 200ms
- if difference between 2 key strokes is <200ms - DECLINE API call
>200ms make an api call and show the result

Cache:
time complexity to search in array = O(n)
time complexity to search in object = O(1)

O(1) far far better than O(n)
